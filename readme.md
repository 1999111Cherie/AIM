#AI for media-Mini Project D(CycleGAN and DcGAN are used to create different art pictures and compare the model performance through experiments)
student number:23011737
student name:Chenyu Zhao

This is a project for artwork generation and creation through model training with CycleGAN and DCGANs. Due to the different models and datasets used, I will introduce the files and code and datasets of CycleGAN and DCGANs in two parts - part1 and part2.

# Introduction
About dataset:

part1-CycleGAN
I used a dataset from the "TensorFlow Datasets" library. I loaded the dataset directly from python by "tfds.load()" function.

CycleGAN code:In this part, I used a lot of the model code from this link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cyclegan?hl=zh-cn

part2-DCGANs
#I've referenced a lot of DCGANs models and code in this project here.

# Here are all the file names:
1."code folder"
Contains two files, one "Part1 CycleGAN code.ipynb" and the other "Part2 DCGANs code.ipynb"
2."Dataset"
Contains one folder is "Part 2 DCGANs dataset". Open "Part 2 DCGANs dataset" contains three file is "Animeface"、"realface"、"Artwork".
3."readme.md"

About dataset part:
In this folder, only includes the dataset for "Part 2 DCGANs dataset", because part1-CycleGAN is a link（https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cycle_gan#cycle_ganiphone2dslr_flower）


# About LLM:
For this project, I only used chatgpt3.5 to check the cause of errors in my code. Otherwise, the code is based on what was taught in class.
